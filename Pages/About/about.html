  <h2>About Me ‚ú¶</h2>
  <div class="about-intro">
    <div class="intro-text">
      <p>I'm Maria Joseph (aka <strong>mjosewings</strong> on GitHub), a coding enthusiast with a flair for style, sarcasm, and social impact. I'm a proud member of the Black, LGBTQ+, and autistic communities. I created VitaSilens to highlight not only my coding projects but also voices often overlooked in tech.</p>
      <p>From bioinformatics to website building, I‚Äôm constantly learning and teaching others as I go. This site is a tribute to that journey‚Äîwith love, coffee, and lots of error messages.</p>

  <h2>Personal Background ‚ùã</h2>
  <p>I grew up balancing a love for science, technology, and creativity. With a deep passion for making information accessible and beautiful, I found myself drawn to the intersections of biology, data, and design. Every project I take on is a blend of logic and artistry‚Äîwhere code meets storytelling.</p>

<section class="journey">
  <h2>My Journey üå∏</h2>
  <p>My path hasn‚Äôt always been linear. It started with a fascination for the hidden patterns in life, leading me to bioinformatics and software development. Along the way, I faced the challenges of navigating spaces that weren't always made for people like me‚Äîbut I stayed grounded, driven, and a little bit defiant. Today, VitaSilens stands as a reflection of resilience, creativity, and the belief that every story deserves to be heard‚Äîeven the quiet ones.</p>

<section class="mission-values">
  <h2>Mission & Values ‚ú¶</h2>
  <p>
    VitaSilens exists to amplify underrepresented voices in tech‚Äîthrough code, design, and fearless authenticity. I believe in accessibility, intersectionality, and innovation rooted in empathy. Every project I create is a protest, a poem, and a promise.
